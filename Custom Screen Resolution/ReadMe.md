# Custom Screen Resolution:

I wrote this tiny bash script to set a custom screen resolution on my pc running Ubuntu mint.

This should ideally work on all debian based PC's.

## How to use it:

1. Just download the file.
2. Open terminal and change directory to the location of the directory of the file.
3. Execute the command below.

```bash
bash custom_screen_resolution.sh
```
